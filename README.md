# Clocks Using JavaScript!

hey there! if you ever wanted to make both analog and digital clocks in one single page, then you can use this repo!

Make sure you have good knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, only if you are gonna edit it to your liking!

## Supports all media screens?

Unfortunately, it supports only media screens above laptops or more. I'll make a seperate repo for mobiles and tablets.
The Clocks will be visible for all devices, but not as neat as laptops or more.

You can take a preview of this!
